        Hack #1: Chase the Sign-Up Bonuses
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph sx={{ fontSize: '16px' }}>
        New card? Grab that juicy sign-up bonusâ€”some offer 50,000 points or $200 cash if you spend a set amount (like $500) in the first 3 months. Itâ€™s free money, folks! <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Time it with a big purchase, but donâ€™t overspend just to hit it.

        Hack #2: Stack Cash Back Like a Boss
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph sx={{ fontSize: '16px' }}>
        Get a card with rotating categories (5% back on groceries, gas, etc.) and pair it with a flat-rate card (1.5% on everything else). Use the right card at the right time, and youâ€™ll be swimming in cash faster than a comedian roasting tax loopholes at Tax and Toasted!

      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph sx={{ fontSize: '16px' }}>
        Donâ€™t cash out points for lame gift cardsâ€”transfer them to travel partners (airlines, hotels) where theyâ€™re often worth 2-3x more. A 50,000-point bonus could snag you a free flight! <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Check your cardâ€™s portal for sweet deals.
